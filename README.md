# Web Design Challenge

## This site does use JQuery to utilize some resuablity (Navbar and Visualization). For this reason it needs be rendered via a server.
Webpage: https://bgalde-dev.github.io/web-design-challenge/

I built two dashboards for this project. On the landing page and on both dashboards you will have access to both dashboards.

The following dashboards are included:

* The dashboard for the base project requirements. This gives an analysis of weather data vs. latitude of various cities around the world.
* The second dashboard is based on a previous project that will visualize data created via a Jupyter Notebook. This data is in regards
to Mouse tumor size vs. several anti-cancer drugs.
